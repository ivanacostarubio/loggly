= loggly

It sends messages to the Loggly API. We do this using resque or without it.

== INSTALL

   gem install loggly

== USAGE

You must sublcass from Loggly and add a class method called token that returns the "input" you get from Loggly

=== For example:

  class TicketLoggly < Loggly
    def self.token
      'token_you_get_from_loggly'
    end
  end


   TicketLoggly.record("This the message")

You can also pass in an optional parameter like: 

   TicketLoggly.record("This is cool", Time.now.to_s)


If you have resque installed, you can send messages using it by doing:

   TicketLogglt.async_record("This will be send using resque")


== Contributing to loggly
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
